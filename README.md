# FedSysID_Python

Python 3.10.13 implementation of **FedSYS**, a federated learning algorithm for system identification. This is a direct translation of the original MATLAB code by Han Wang et al. (2022).

In addition to FedSYS, **FedProx** is also implemented to compare **FedLin**, **FedProx**, and **FedAvg**. A script to benchmark the execution time of these algorithms is included.
